MissingOutputException in line 52 of /Users/jenniferblanc/PGS-differences-confounding/snakefile_4PopSplit:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
output/Simulate_Genotypes/4PopSplit/A1/genos.vcf
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job simulate_genotypes_4popsplit since they might be corrupted:
output/Simulate_Genotypes/4PopSplit/A1/genos.pop
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
